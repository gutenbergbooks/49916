<h1>THE TENTH MAN</h1>

<h2><a name="THE_FIRST_ACT" id="THE_FIRST_ACT"></a>THE FIRST ACT</h2>

<div class="blockquott"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <i>A drawing-room at</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Francis Etchingham’s</span> <i>house in
Norfolk Street, Park Lane. An Adam room, with bright chintzes on
the furniture, photographs on the chimney-piece and the piano, and
a great many flowers. There is an archway at the back, leading into
another drawing-room, and it is through this that visitors are
introduced by the butler. On the left is a large bow window, and on
the right a door leading into the library.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquott"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Lord</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Francis</span>.</p></div>

<div class="blockquott"><p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Lord Francis Etchingham</span> <i>is a man of fifty, of the middle height,
rather bald, with an amiable, weak face. He is a good-natured
person, anxious to do his best in all things and to all people so
long as he is not bored. He wants everything to go smoothly. He has
a comfortable idea of his own capacity. Reduced circumstances have
drawn him into affairs, and he regards himself as a fine man of
business.</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Francis</span> <i>is a handsome and well-preserved woman of
the same age as her husband, with dyed red hair; she has a
massive,<a name="page_002" id="page_002"></a> almost an imposing, presence, and she is admirably
gowned. She treats her husband with good-humoured scorn, aware of
his foibles, but amused rather than annoyed by them. When the
curtain rises</i> <span class="smcap">Francis Etchingham</span> <i>is a prey to the liveliest
vexation. He is walking nervously across the room, while his wife,
with a thin smile, stands quietly watching him. With a gesture of
irritation he flings himself into a chair.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Why the dickens didn’t you tell me last night, Angela?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I had no wish to disturb my night’s rest.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Upon my soul, I don’t know what you mean. It’s incomprehensible to me
that you should have slept like a top. I couldn’t have closed my eyes
the whole night.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>I know. And you would have taken excellent care that I shouldn’t close
mine either.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I should have thought I had enough to do without being pestered with a
foolish woman’s matrimonial difficulties.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a laugh.</i>] You really have a very detached way of looking at
things, Frank. No one would<a name="page_003" id="page_003"></a> imagine, to hear you speak, that the
foolish woman in question was your daughter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Really, Angela, I must beg you not to make this a subject of flippancy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Good-humouredly.</i>] Well, what do you propose to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Flying out of his chair.</i>] Do? What do you expect me to do? You tell
me that Kate came home at twelve o’clock last night without a stitch of
clothing....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>My dear, if I told you that I was most unwarrantably distorting the
truth.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Irritably correcting himself.</i>] In a ball dress, with an opera cloak
on&mdash;without her luggage, without even a dressing-case&mdash;and informs you
that she’s left her husband.... It’s absurd.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Quite absurd. And so unnecessarily dramatic.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>And when’s she going home?<a name="page_004" id="page_004"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>She assures me that she’s not going home.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Almost beside himself.</i>] She’s not going to stay here?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Those are her plans at the moment.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>And George?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>You don’t suppose her husband’s going to put up with this nonsense? Has
he made no sign?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Ten minutes after she arrived he sent a messenger boy&mdash;with a
toothbrush.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Why a toothbrush?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know. Presumably to brush her teeth.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Well, that shows he doesn’t look upon the matter<a name="page_005" id="page_005"></a> as serious. Of course,
it was a whim on Kate’s part. Luckily he’s coming here this morning....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] Is he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Yes, he promised to fetch me in his car. We’re going to drive down to
the City together. I’ll bring him in, and meanwhile you can talk to
Kate. I dare say she’s thought better of it already. It only wants a
little tact, and we can settle the whole thing. George is clever enough
to have given some plausible explanation to the servants.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Are you really under the impression things are going to pass off in that
way?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Why not?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>They say it’s a wise man who knows his own father, but it’s apparently a
wiser man still who knows his own daughter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Angela, for goodness’ sake don’t try to be bright and amusing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Do you know so little of Kate as to imagine she<a name="page_006" id="page_006"></a> would have taken a step
of this kind without having quite made up her mind?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>You don’t mean to say you think Kate will refuse to go back to her
husband?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>I do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>But what reasons does she give? Why did she say she left him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>She gave no reasons. She merely stated the fact and asked if I could put
her up.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Well, she must go back to her husband.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As if it were the most innocent question.</i>] Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Because a woman’s place is by her husband’s side, Angela. You know just
as well as I do that I can’t afford to quarrel with George Winter. I’m
chairman of half a dozen of his companies. The position would be
intolerable. I should be expected to take Kate’s side if she were right
or wrong.<a name="page_007" id="page_007"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>I suppose you owe him money?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>No, not exactly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Ah! [<i>With a shrewd look at him and a smile.</i>] And how much is it that
you&mdash;don’t exactly owe him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>We’re mixed up together in any number of business undertakings, and
naturally we have a sort of running account. If we settled up I dare say
I should have to find something like fifteen thousand pounds.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens, I thought you’d been making money.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I did, but the fact is, we’ve been very badly hit lately.
Practically all our interests are in Central America, and we couldn’t
foresee that there’d be a revolution there.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>The possibility might have crossed your mind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I knew you’d blame me. And I suppose you’ll blame me because a
confounded earthquake smashed up one of our railways.<a name="page_008" id="page_008"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>And how d’you propose to raise fifteen thousand pounds?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>That’s just it. It would be devilish awkward. And George is in a
confounded tight place too.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>You’d better talk to Kate. I’ll send for her.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She touches a bell, and gives her order down a speaking tube.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Ask Mrs. Winter to be good enough to come to the drawing room.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>You must talk to her seriously, Angela. You must tell her that her
behaviour is outrageous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] No, my dear. You are going to talk to her.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Catherine Winter</span> <i>comes in. She is a graceful woman, with a
strong, passionate face; and her expression, rather tired but
self-contained and resolute, suggests that she has endured great
trouble and is now making a desperate effort to escape. She is very
simply dressed and wears no jewellery but her wedding ring.</i></p></div>

<p><a name="page_009" id="page_009"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Good-morning, father.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She goes up to</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Francis</span> <i>and kisses his cheek</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With elaborate politeness.</i>] Be so good as to sit down, Catherine.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Catherine</span> <i>exchanges with her mother a glance of faint amusement
and takes a seat</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a fine assumption of paternal authority.</i>] I want to talk to you.
Your mother and I have sent for you.... [<i>Breaking out.</i>] Now what does
all this mean? It’s ridiculous nonsense. You’re surely old enough to
have learnt a little self-control.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Calmly.</i>] I’ve shown a good deal of self-control during the four years
of my married life, father. I was afraid it was growing into a habit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Am I to understand that what your mother tells me is true?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quietly.</i>] I lived with George as long as I could. I put up with more
than any woman I know would have done. But there are some things no one
should suffer who has any self-respect.<a name="page_010" id="page_010"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>You’ve never complained before of George’s behaviour.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Why have you never said a word to your mother about it? I can’t imagine
why you shouldn’t get on with George. I don’t suppose you’ve ever
expressed a whim that he hasn’t gratified. Your allowance is princely.
Your pearls are the envy of every woman in London.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, he’s generous. My pearls have been a splendid advertisement.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ignoring the second sentence and pouncing on the admission.</i>] Then
what have you got to complain of?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I dare say my mother knows what half London is chattering about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Well, Angela?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, I hoped it was idle gossip. A man as much in the public eye
as George Winter&mdash;the most prominent financier of the moment&mdash;is certain
to be talked about.<a name="page_011" id="page_011"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I suppose he’s been flirting with two or three pretty women.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>I understand things are supposed to have gone rather further than that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>That’s the kind of thing a tactful woman must close her eyes to. You’re
a woman of the world, Kate. You know what men are. You must extend a
certain degree of licence to a man of George Winter’s temperament.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>You don’t understand, father. I bore my life till I couldn’t bear it any
longer. I’m not the sort of woman to make scenes. I held my tongue, I
closed my eyes, till something happened which I couldn’t endure. I’ve
left him fully decided to divorce him. Nothing that you can say will
move me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>But you can’t divorce him. You’ve accused him of nothing but infidelity.
You can’t be so ignorant of the law....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] I’m not at all ignorant of the law. I assure you that
he has complied fully with all the conditions which are needful.<a name="page_012" id="page_012"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Kate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Please don’t ask me. I feel that my whole soul is foul with....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Well, of course there are always two sides to every question.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh, father, you’re not going to tell me that that, too, is usual in
polite society, for a man to.... Oh!</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She gives a gesture and a cry of disgust.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>I wonder if you’d go and read your <i>Times</i>, Frank. I should like to talk
to Katie alone.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a look from his wife to his daughter.</i>] Eh, very well. Perhaps
you can do something with her. Tell her what it means if she persists. I
suppose I shall find the <i>Times</i> in the library.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He goes out.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] Your father has such a power of delusion. He never
looks at anything but the <i>Daily Mail</i>, but he’s quite convinced that he
reads nothing but the <i>Times</i>.<a name="page_013" id="page_013"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Passionately.</i>] Oh, mother, you’ll stand by me, won’t you? You know
what I’ve gone through. If you care for me at all you must have some
pity.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Lady Francis</span> <i>looks at her coolly. She is quite unmoved by the
vehemence of the appeal. She pauses for a moment before answering.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Why have you chosen this particular moment to leave your husband?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>There are limits to human endurance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>You’ve lived a good deal apart. Like civilized people you’ve made the
best of a mutual want of sympathy. I should have thought George
interfered with you very little. I have an idea that no woman would care
to undergo the&mdash;inconvenience of proceedings for divorce without a very
good reason. You’ve got a peculiarly fastidious taste, Katie. It must be
something rather out of the way that induces you to expose your private
life to all and sundry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>It’s merely a choice of ignominies.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Lady Francis</span> <i>pauses an instant, then raps out the question
sharply</i>.</p></div>

<p>You have no right to ask me that, mother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a slight smile.</i>] Your indignation is almost an answer in itself,
isn’t it? I suppose you want to marry.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Catherine</span> <i>does not answer. She takes a step or two impatiently.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p>I’ve got nothing to be ashamed of.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>In that case, I should have thought you had nothing to conceal.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Defiantly.</i>] I haven’t. When I thought that everything was over for me
and that life was meaningless, I found it was only just beginning. And I
thanked God for all I’d gone through because perhaps it made me less
unfit for the great love that descended upon me.<a name="page_015" id="page_015"></a></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>And you’ve made your arrangements, I suppose, to be married as soon as
the decree is made absolute?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>We haven’t discussed the matter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Your father wishes me to tell you that if you quarrel with George it
will ruin him. He could hardly keep the position that George has given
him on his various boards.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>You will be no worse off than before I married.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Except that it appears your father owes George fifteen thousand pounds.<a name="page_016" id="page_016"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Do you want to cheat me again out of the little happiness that seems in
store for me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>I want you to do what is right in your own eyes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>It’s infamous that you should come here. If you had any decent
feeling....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Blandly.</i>] My dear child, I had a business engagement with your
father. It’s unreasonable to expect me not to keep it because you have
temporarily abandoned the conjugal roof.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To her father.</i>] You might have warned me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>My dear, I was hoping that after a talk with your mother you’d have....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] What can I do to show you that I’ve made up my mind
for good and all?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Even after one’s made up one’s mind, it’s not too late to listen to
reason.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>I think for all our sakes you should listen to anything that George has
to say.<a name="page_018" id="page_018"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">George Winter</span>.] Do you understand what my mother means?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a little chuckle.</i>] I dimly suspect.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>My father owes you a lot of money. He’s chairman of half your companies.
He thinks that if I divorce you he’ll have to pay that money....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure his sense of delicacy would prevent him from remaining in my
debt.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>And you’ll make him resign his directorships?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With his tongue in his cheek.</i>] I know him well enough to feel certain
that he would never wish to retain them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh, it’s vile.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Or is it common sense?<a name="page_019" id="page_019"></a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>There is a moment’s pause, and when</i> <span class="smcap">George Winter</span> <i>speaks it is
with great seriousness</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Now look here, Kate; listen to me carefully. You know that all our
interests are in Central America. The Lewishams had it all their own way
out there till I came along. They owned the railways and the mines and
the trams&mdash;everything that was worth having. Well, I knew I couldn’t
oust them, but I thought I could make them take me in. I’ve been
fighting them tooth and nail for ten years. They’ve done all they could
to smash me by fair means and foul, but they haven’t succeeded. And now
I’m in sight of my goal. I can force them to come to terms.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>All this is nothing to me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>The Lewishams got on to a big thing&mdash;a mine called the Campo del Oro.
But that earthquake the other day queered their pitch, and they offered
bills when hard cash was the only thing to do the trick. I thought that
what was good enough for the Lewishams was good enough for me. I knew
that if I could get it they’d have to take me in. I had two hours to
think it over. I found the cash and bought the mine last week.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>It doesn’t interest me.<a name="page_020" id="page_020"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>It will. I sent Macdonald out there.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Macdonald is George’s expert. He’s the soundest man in the profession.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>And straight, straight as a die. I’m expecting his report every day. He
may cable me at any moment. Then I shall get to work. I’m going to float
the mine as a company with a capital of half a million. Your father will
be chairman, and he ought to make close on fifty thousand out of it. For
a reason I needn’t tell you, we can’t afford to wait. We must have ready
money, and that means floating the company at once. My only chance is in
Middlepool, where three parts of my backing have come from before. We
shall soon be in the middle of a General Election. And you know how
uncertain my seat in Middlepool is. I keep it only by my personal
popularity. I’m at the mercy of the Nonconformists, and if there’s talk
of a divorce it’s all U.P. with me. They’ll make me retire before the
election, and if that happens the new company won’t stand a dog’s
chance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Because with the general public nervous, I shall have to depend on
Middlepool, and there I can only float it on my personal character.<a name="page_021" id="page_021"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid you’ll think it very selfish, but I haven’t any more power of
self-sacrifice in me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>If the Campo del Oro is a failure, it’ll knock down all the other
companies I’m connected with. The Lewishams will seize the opportunity
to make a raid on me. I’m standing on the edge of a precipice, and
anyone who cares to give me a shove will send me over.... It’ll mean
your father’s ruin and mine&mdash;I dare say you don’t mind that&mdash;but it’ll
also mean the ruin of thousands of poor investors all over the country.
Three-quarters of the population of Middlepool will lose their savings.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>You’ve lied to me so often, George.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I can show you by plain figures that every word I say is true.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I haven’t much sympathy with the gamblers who want to make money without
working for it. If they lose, it’s their own look out.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>There is a pause.</i> <span class="smcap">George Winter</span> <i>looks at her and nods to

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>D’you want to repeat that odious scene of last night? Surely we said all
that we had to say to one another.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shrugging his shoulders.</i>] You know, I wouldn’t have played the fool
with other women if you hadn’t shown me very clearly that you didn’t
want to have anything to do with me.<a name="page_023" id="page_023"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I would rather not discuss that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] After all, it isn’t as if I cared a tinker’s cuss
for the whole lot of them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Flushing.</i>] And you think that makes it any better? I think I could
have forgiven you if you’d had any love for those wretched women. But it
wasn’t even that. You exposed me to all that humiliation merely to
gratify your vanity. When I’ve seen how you’ve treated those women I,
even I, have been sorry for them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>If you like I’ll give you my solemn word of honour that you shall have
no cause to complain in future.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>It’s too late. You’ve given me my chance of freedom and I mean to take
it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You’re not keeping your part of the bargain.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>What d’you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You didn’t marry me because you were in love with me....<a name="page_024" id="page_024"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] That’s not true.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] Think.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hesitating.</i>] A year ago I would have said again that it wasn’t true.
I didn’t know what love was.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You married me because I was rich.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Passionately.</i>] No, no.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I’d just won a seat that they’d given me because they thought I hadn’t a
chance. I won it off my own bat, because I imposed myself on Middlepool
and forced them to vote for me. I was in the public eye. I was a power
already. The world seemed at my feet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>All that’s very harmless. You flattered me. The life you offered me
seemed so large, so full, and I was very young. I was dazzled by your
brilliancy and your success. I mistook it for love.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>And I married you because I wanted a wife. You happened to have an uncle
who’s a duke, and aristocratic<a name="page_025" id="page_025"></a> connexions are devilish useful in
England to a Radical politician.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Bitterly.</i>] Oh, yes, I found out soon enough why you married me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>It was a business arrangement on both sides, and you’ve had your full
share of the profits.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Outraged.</i>] Oh, how can you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You’d always lived in a pokey way and I gave you magnificence. I’ve kept
even the spirit of my part of the bargain. Your father wasn’t mentioned
in the settlements. But every stick of furniture in this house has been
bought with my money. The very clothes on your mother’s back are paid
for by me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>That’s not true.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You don’t think your father is worth the money I give him. He’s as
incompetent as all the rest of these damned fools who come from the
West-End and think they can make money in the City. The nincompoop
thinks himself a financial authority. The charwoman of a bucket-shop
could give him points.<a name="page_026" id="page_026"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>He has his name and his position.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Nowadays even a country curate will fight shy of a title on a
prospectus. The salaries he gets are merely payments for you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh, you’ve said all this so often. For years you’ve bullied me with your
money. I was such a fool, because you said it was dishonest of me to go,
rather than that even you should have the smallest cause to blame me, I
bore everything. I clenched my hands and suffered.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] In a diamond tiara and a Paquin dress.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I thought I should have the strength to suffer to the end. But I
haven’t. If you bought an article and it hasn’t turned out worth the
money you gave for it, that’s your look out. You see, you’ve taught me
something after all.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>A very short pause.</i> <span class="smcap">George Winter</span> <i>makes up his mind to try

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Now, look here; I’m willing to meet you half-way. I don’t ask you to
come back to me. You can live as you like and where you like. I’ll give
you five thousand a year. Your father can keep his directorships.<a name="page_027" id="page_027"></a> The
only thing I ask is that you shouldn’t apply for a divorce and that you
should appear with me at certain public functions.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Passionately.</i>] I want to be free. I’ve lived in an atmosphere of lies
and hypocrisy till I can hardly breathe. Your good nature is merely a
pose. Your generosity is merely an advertisement. You care for nothing
but your own self-advancement. And I want to be rid of the horrible
feeling that all sorts of shady things are going on around me that I
don’t know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sharply.</i>] What d’you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I know that you’re not honest.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>With a cry of rage</i> <span class="smcap">George Winter</span> <i>seizes her by the shoulders

<p>What d’you mean? What d’you mean? What d’you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>You’re hurting me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

that to me?<a name="page_028" id="page_028"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Let me go.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Why don’t you answer? What d’you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking herself free.</i>] I’ll tell you what I mean. I know that if the
occasion arose you wouldn’t hesitate to steal.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a laugh of relief.</i>] Is that all?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>For years I’ve been tortured by the horror of it. Each pearl you’ve
given me&mdash;and you’ve thrust them upon me&mdash;I’ve asked myself if it was
honestly come by. And that’s why I want to escape from you&mdash;not only
because you’ve been odiously cruel to me, even now when you’re trying to
persuade me to return to you, and because you’ve flaunted before me one
vulgar intrigue after another&mdash;but because I feel that all this wealth
rests on lying, and swindling, and roguery.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Banteringly.</i>] Well, you must confess that so far I’ve been eminently
successful in not getting found out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking no notice of his remark.</i>] And now surely you have nothing more
to say to me.<a name="page_029" id="page_029"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a bland smile.</i>] My dear, knowing how important it is to me that
you should return to the conjugal roof, you don’t imagine I have come
without some means to persuade you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I assure you you’re wasting your time. You’ve always told me it was
valuable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>In his most delightful manner.</i>] You seem to be under the delusion it
rests with you to make conditions.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I make no conditions. I merely announce my decision.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking a letter from his pocket and quietly smoothing it out on a
table.</i>] I’ve never suffered from that form of snobbishness which makes
many self-made men hurl their origin in the face of a British public
only too anxious to pretend it thinks them the scions of a noble house.
But I have never concealed from you that mine was humble.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p><a name="page_030" id="page_030"></a>[<i>Suspiciously.</i>] What is that paper?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ignoring the question.</i>] That is one of the pills you had to swallow
when I married you and your excellent but impoverished family. I started
life with neither friend nor money, but with exceptionally fine parts. I
soon discovered that the simplest way to succeed is by blackmail. It is
astonishing how many men keep a large-sized skeleton in their cupboards.
If you only get a sight of those discreditable bones, you can often make
a whole family your bosom friends. I’m not boring you, am I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>You’re torturing me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>This is a copy of a letter which you may remember. The original was so
crumpled that I can’t help thinking you were romantic enough to sleep
with it under your pillow. It begins: My very dear friend....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] How did you get that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I can never understand why people are such fools as to write
love-letters. I never do. I only send telegrams.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at the Bramah-key on her bracelet.</i>] You broke it open?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>When I made you a present of your dressing-case, I kept the duplicate
key in case you lost yours.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>It’s infamous. It’s&mdash;it’s just like you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Why on earth were you so incautious as to leave it behind?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indignantly.</i>] I thought I could trust you. It never struck me that
you’d pry into my private papers.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] Nonsense. You were so taken with the dramatic
gesture of leaving the house in a pink satin opera cloak that you forgot
all about it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>There’s nothing in any of my letters that I’m ashamed of.<a name="page_032" id="page_032"></a></p>

<p>Would you like to look at this one?</p>

<p>[<i>Refusing to take it.</i>] I know that there can be absolutely no harm in
it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I wonder what a clever counsel would make of it. I can imagine it read
in such a manner that those vague words should gather form and
substance. A little irony, a grotesque emphasis here and there, and I
can see the junior bar rolling with laughter. I don’t imagine a
parliamentary light like your friend Robert Colby would take ridicule
very well. It’s only by his entire lack of humour that he’s risen to the
exalted position he now adorns.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Frightened.</i>] What d’you mean, George?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

that’s all. You want to wash your dirty linen in public, let’s have an
entire spring cleaning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Scornfully.</i>] Oh, my dear George, if you only knew how indifferent I
am to such a threat! We haven’t done anything with which we can reproach
ourselves.<a name="page_033" id="page_033"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Banteringly.</i>] You astonish me, my dear Kate. Surely it can’t have
slipped your memory that Robert Colby, snatching a brief and well-earned
holiday from affairs of state, made a tour of North Italy last Easter,
and you accompanied him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Flaring up.</i>] That’s not true. You know it’s not true. I went with
Barbara Herbert....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting, with a twinkle in his eye.</i>] And a maid. It’s always a
little unsafe to trust maids, especially Scotch maids with strongly
religious principles.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>What have you been doing?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking a paper out of his pocket.</i>] Here is another interesting little
document that I’ve been at some pains to acquire. Being, alas! aware
that the wife of my bosom might&mdash;turn troublesome one day or another, I
thought it safe to have a weapon in my hand for future use. It is a list
of the hotels at which you stayed. Shall I read it to you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>If you choose.<a name="page_034" id="page_034"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hugely amused.</i>] At Milan you stayed at the <i>Palace</i>, and Robert Colby
at the <i>Cavour</i>.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sarcastically.</i>] Damning, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>But perhaps finding the <i>Palace</i> noisy, and trusting in Mr. Robert
Colby’s better judgment, at Venice you both stayed at the <i>Danielli</i>.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a shrug of the shoulders.</i>] Where else should one stay?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I find in my Baedeker that there are twenty-seven hotels in Venice, but
I daresay it was very natural that you should both hit upon the
<i>Danielli</i>. And you took the precaution of arriving twenty hours after
him. But at Ravenna, flinging prudence to the winds, you arrived on the
same day, by the same train, and you put up at the same hotel.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>There is only one.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You had rooms seventeen and eighteen, and Barbara Herbert had room
five.<a name="page_035" id="page_035"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>There was only one vacant room on the first floor, and of course I
insisted that Barbara should take it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Unselfish in the extreme, and just like you, my dear; but don’t you
think it was a little indiscreet?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>We had nothing to be ashamed of, and therefore we had nothing to fear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I’ve often thought that was the greatest drawback of innocence. It makes
one so devilish imprudent.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I went to Italy with your express consent. I wrote and told you that I’d
met Robert Colby. Chance threw us together in Venice; we found we were
making practically the same tour, and we joined forces. I saw no harm in
it. I see no harm in it now. You can make what use of the admissions you
like.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>And do you think you will be able to persuade a British jury that you
and Robert Colby travelled through Italy together merely to look at
churches and pictures?<a name="page_036" id="page_036"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>George, I know now that I never cared for you, but I promise you on my
word of honour that I’ve never been unfaithful to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>My dear, it’s not a question of convincing me&mdash;I am the most trusting,
the most credulous of mortals&mdash;but of convincing the twelve good men and
true who form a British jury.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>You’re not a fool, George. You know people, and you know what I’m
capable of and what I’m not. In your heart you’re certain that I’ve done
nothing that can give you any cause for complaint. I’ve suffered a great
deal during these four years&mdash;I wouldn’t wish my worst enemy to go
through what I have&mdash;I implore you not to drag me through this horror.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>My dear, your simple-mindedness positively takes me aback.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indignantly.</i>] How can you be so ignoble?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Dropping his bantering tone, quickly and sternly.</i>] You must know me
very little, Kate. My whole life is at stake, and you think I’m going to
be moved by entreaties or abuse? I’m at the most critical point of my
career. Part of my strength is that I never<a name="page_037" id="page_037"></a> deceive myself. I’m only an
adventurer. My millions are paper millions, and I want to be in such a
position that if I’m in need of half a million I can go to the big men
and get it, and if one of them asks me for half a million I can afford
to put it down. And now, if only I hold on, I shall get everything I
want. And you come and whine before me and play the fool. What d’you
think I care for your twopenny-halfpenny love-affairs? Do what you like.
I don’t care, so long as you’re not flagrant.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indignantly.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>That anyone can be such a fool as to let love interfere with his life!
It’s so unimportant.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>To me it means the whole world.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Well, I give you your choice. If you bring an action against me I bring
a counter-petition.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Stung into defiance.</i>] My choice is made long ago. I’m strong in my
innocence.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You’ll ruin me and ruin your father, but you’ll ruin Robert Colby as
well.<a name="page_038" id="page_038"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quickly.</i>] What do you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You don’t mean to say you’re so simple-minded as to imagine he can do
anything but resign his seat if he were made co-respondent in a divorce
case? They say, if we get in again, he’s to be given the Ministry of
War. Humpty-Dumpty. It’s the end of his political career.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Desperately.</i>] We have nothing to reproach ourselves with. Nothing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You sent a note to him last night. What did you say?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Defiantly.</i>] I asked him to come here at twelve o’clock.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking out his watch.</i>] It’s nearly twelve now. I’ll wait. And you
shall talk to him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>He’s in his usual rude health, thank you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I’ve brought Teddie to introduce him to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>How d’you do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a flourish.</i>] This is the Napoleon of Finance. He owns seventeen
companies, five gold mines, two railways, a house in Portman Square, two
places in the country, a yacht, five motor-cars, the family of

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] Take a long breath and say ninety-nine.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I? [<i>Coaxingly.</i>] You’re an old dear, George.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I thought so. Well, what is it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I want you to give Mr. O’Donnell a job.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Anne!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>I say, Nan, you needn’t put it so bluntly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It’s no good beating about the bush with George, is it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Amused and pleased.</i>] Not much.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Now, sit down and let me talk sensibly to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Anne, I’d rather you didn’t&mdash;just now. George and I are busy.<a name="page_041" id="page_041"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Have they interrupted you, darling? I thought you had nothing more you
wanted to say.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Is anything the matter?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Nothing. Kate’s a little under the weather this morning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, I’m so sorry. What is it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I warned you not to eat that <i>pâté de foie gras</i> last night, my dear. It
always disagrees with you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Please don’t worry about me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Anne</span>.] Why d’you want me to give Mr. O’Donnell a job?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Because he’s my young man.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Is he, by Jove!<a name="page_042" id="page_042"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>I offered her my hand and heart....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] And being a practical person I promptly inquired what
were his worldly possessions.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>They’re not only nil, they’re astonishingly nil. In point of fact, if
you reckon debts they’re positively minus.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>So I fell into his arms and said, let us put up the banns at once.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very jolly and affable.</i>] That’s where I come in.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Well, I thought he might manage one of your railways or be your
chauffeur, or if you didn’t think he was good enough for that you might
make him director of one of your companies.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Nan, you don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens, if papa can direct companies surely Teddie can.<a name="page_043" id="page_043"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>No, I didn’t mean that. But there are circumstances that you don’t
understand. Mr. O’Donnell can’t ask George to do anything for him. Mr.
O’Donnell....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quite good-humouredly.</i>] Really, Kate, you might let me answer for
myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>George always said he’d help me when I wanted to marry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">O’Donnell</span>.] I presume your idea is to go into the City?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>Yes, more or less.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Educated at a public school, I suppose?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I was at Harrow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a twinkle in his eye.</i>] Then I may take it that you tried to get
into the Army and failed?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I suppose I did.<a name="page_044" id="page_044"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>And you hadn’t got enough money to go into the diplomatic?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>How on earth d’you know, George?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>When a young man of family and education tells me he wants to go into
the City, I know it’s because he’s too incompetent to do anything else.
Fifty years ago the fool of good family went into the Church, now he
goes into the City.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>You’re not very flattering.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I dare say you’ll suit me all right.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, George, you are a brick.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Give me a kiss and I’ll find him a job.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I shan’t find him two jobs.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I can’t imagine why everybody’s so afraid of you, George. You’re an old
dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>A heart of gold, that’s what I always tell Kate. [<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">O’Donnell</span>.] Come
and see me to-morrow morning, and we’ll have a talk about things.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>It’s awfully good of you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You know, you’ll have to do as you’re told if you come to me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>I dare say I shan’t mind that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>It’s not always pleasant being at the beck and call of a damned bounder.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>How d’you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Of course you look upon me as a damned bounder. I know that. I wasn’t
educated at Harrow. My<a name="page_046" id="page_046"></a> father was a hatter at Middlepool, a
Nonconformist, and an aitchless one at that. I went to sea when I was
fourteen, and when I was your age I was earning twenty-five bob a week
as clerk in a bucket shop. Of course I’m a damned bounder.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Now, George, don’t be disagreeable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Well, run along, children.... Have you spoken to your father about this?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>No, we’re going to leave you to do that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Are you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Well, you see, father’s sure to kick up a bit of a row because Teddie’s
so absolutely stony, but if you say you’ve given him a job....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Father may object....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he wouldn’t dare if George said it was all right.</p>

<p>[<i>Coolly.</i>] Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>We can accept nothing from you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>This disinterestedness is rather a new trait in your family, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>You’re only wasting his time in making him come down to see you
to-morrow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Anne will have to be told the facts, and she’ll see at once that it’s
out of the question for Teddie to accept favours from you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I wonder.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Defiantly.</i>] I have no doubt of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Do you think she’ll be pleased when she’s told that, owing to your
unreasonableness, her marriage can’t take place? Are you sure she won’t
say that she has no quarrel with me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I should make her understand.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>It seems rather selfish on your part, doesn’t it? If Anne’s heart is set
upon marrying this rather foolish boy, have <i>you</i> the heart to prevent
her?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I’ve sacrificed myself long enough. It’s Anne’s turn now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You’ll find self-sacrifice one of the forms of self-indulgence in which
people are never wildly anxious to take turn and turn about.<a name="page_049" id="page_049"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>What can you do with Teddie O’Donnell? He’s no good to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I’m not sure. I like dealing with gentlemen. When they go into the City
they take to dirty work with an alacrity which you often don’t find in
the City man born and bred.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Even if there was nothing else, I would do all I could to prevent a
decent boy from being exposed to your influence.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Well, you may try yours on Anne. Tell her that I’ll start her young man
on four hundred a year, and I’ll allow her a couple of hundred more, so
that they can marry next week if they want to. And add that you are
divorcing me, and it would be monstrous if either of them accepted my
offer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I know well enough that you didn’t make him pretty speeches because
you took any interest in doing a kindness. It was merely another coil of
the chain you’ve twisted round me. Oh, it’s fiendish. Each way I turn I
find that you bar my way.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>You know very well wild labour leaders couldn’t have prevented me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Of course I know you wouldn’t really let me interfere with anything
serious, but it’s very pleasant to flatter myself that the whole country
is waiting while you’re wasting your time with me. D’you know what I’ve
done?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>I suspected what your note meant, but I’m anxious to hear it from your
own lips.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I’ve crossed the Rubicon. I’m seeing my solicitor to-day, and the
petition will be filed as soon as ever it’s possible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>I’m so glad. You had no right to go on with that degrading life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I want you to assure me again that I’m right. I’m so weak. I feel so
utterly defenceless.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>It won’t be very long now before....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] No, not yet, Robert.<a name="page_053" id="page_053"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>I want to tell you at once how passionately I love you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With the tenderest of smiles.</i>] D’you think it’s needful? I’m so glad
to think you’ve never made love to me. There was all the love I wanted
in the look of your eyes, and your voice, though you said quite
commonplace things, told me that you cared for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>I’ve never even kissed your hand, Kate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I’m very grateful to you. Now more than ever I want to feel quite sure
that we have nothing to reproach ourselves with.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>It’s rather hard on me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Do you think I find it any easier? Sometimes when I’ve been dreadfully
lonely, dreadfully wretched, I’ve longed to be able to rest my head on
your shoulder, and I’ve thought I might have loved my tears if you could
have kissed them away.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>Were you angry with me when I wrote to you? The one foolish letter?<a name="page_054" id="page_054"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>How could I be?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>I was dreadfully unhappy then. Everything I tried seemed to go wrong. I
was utterly dispirited, and I couldn’t help writing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I read the letter till I knew every word by heart. Sometimes I wonder
how I could have borne my life at all except for the knowledge that you
cared for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>You’ve never once told me that you love me, Kate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>D’you want me to say it in so many words? Why else d’you think I’m
exposing myself to all the humiliation, all the horrors that are before
me? Yes, I love you with all my heart and soul.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>And after it’s all over?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>It shall be as you wish.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>You’ve meant so much to me, Kate. All the<a name="page_055" id="page_055"></a> success I’ve had I feel that
I owe to you. Sometimes I’ve hated the intrigues and the littleness of
politics. I’ve been tempted to give the whole thing up. But you put
fresh courage into me. It’s because of you that I’ve been able to ignore
the rest and just keep my eyes fixed always on the greatness of the aim.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] It makes me so proud to hear you say that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Lightly.</i>] Did you read the speech I made yesterday?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>No, I’m afraid I haven’t yet.</p>

<p>Colby.</p>

<p>[<i>Gaily.</i>] Wretched woman! And every jack one of the papers has given a
leader on it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I’m so sorry. It’s horrid of me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Laughing.</i>] What nonsense! Of course you’ve had much more important
things to think about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Tell me all about it. I suppose it was the Army debate.<a name="page_056" id="page_056"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I burnt my ships behind me. I said I thought some form of
compulsory service was essential. Perigal’s going to the country at
once. I think we shall get in. And if we do ... I wish to goodness
they’d give me the War Office. Of course, after six years in office we
can only hope for a small majority, and every seat will count. I wonder
what will happen at Middlepool.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>George is very popular.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>Yes, that’s just it. As long as he was there the seat was safe. I wonder
if anyone else will be able to hold it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Do you think it will be impossible for him to stand again?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>Quite. And rightly. No man’s obliged to go into Parliament. If he does
it’s his duty to keep clear of scandal.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Catherine</span> <i>gives a very slight start, and when she speaks her
voice is not quite steady</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>That might be very difficult. A man might be an object of scandal, and
yet be perfectly innocent. Supposing&mdash;a malicious person brought an
action for<a name="page_057" id="page_057"></a> divorce against him. It might be merely an attempt at
blackmail. It would be monstrous to punish him for something that wasn’t
his fault.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>D’you honestly think that’s a possible case? If a man is shot at&mdash;it’s
true he may not be technically guilty&mdash;but he can hardly be blameless.
If a case can be made out at all against him he must have done something
very foolish.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Catherine</span> <i>does not answer. She is terrified at what he says.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>George Winter only went into the House for his private ambition. He
contested a seat in order to give himself a stronger financial position,
and now he wants to use his money to force himself into some sort of
job. We’ve got no use for people like that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>As if she were changing the conversation.</i>] I wonder what you’d do if
you were beaten at the General Election?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a laugh.</i>] I don’t think my constituents will throw me out as
long as I behave myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] And if they did?<a name="page_058" id="page_058"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a little pause.</i>] It would just about break me up. Politics are
my whole life. I can’t imagine existence without the House of Commons.
And I have so much to do. If they’ll only give me a chance I want to....
[<i>Suddenly stopping himself.</i>] But, good heavens, I’m just going to make
a speech.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, I’m so proud of you. I admire you so enormously.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gaily.</i>] Not yet. Hang it all, wait to admire me till I’m Minister of
War.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With an affectionate smile.</i>] You dear.... Now you must go. I’ve got
ever so much to do, and I’m sure you ought to have.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>Good-bye, then. God bless you.... Say something nice to me before I
leave you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I shall think of you all day long.<a name="page_059" id="page_059"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Flippantly.</i>] Put him under a glass case.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>You may find him awkward to deal with. Take care.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I shall. But I’ve looked for him so long that I can’t help thinking he
doesn’t move in my set.... Now and then I’ve thought I’d really got him.
But while I was scratching my head and wondering how the deuce I was

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Very good, sir.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He goes out.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean by this?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>That’s precisely what I came to tell you.... I suppose you’ve been
talking. There’ve been references to a dispute between us in the
Middlepool papers, and the <i>Herald</i>, the Conservative rag, has stated in
the current issue that you are divorcing me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>The Middlepool papers are singularly well-informed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>That’s where you’re mistaken. The <i>Argus</i> is printing a special edition
with a complete and authoritative denial of the whole story. I’ve issued
a writ for libel against the <i>Herald</i>.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>One lie more or less on your conscience can make no great difference to
you.<a name="page_073" id="page_073"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I’ve explained your presence here by your susceptibility to fresh paint.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] The day after Kate left Portman Square I came to the
conclusion that the house needed re-decorating. I’m having it papered
and painted from cellar to attic. When it’s finished I shall start
again.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Fortunately the British workman takes his time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>But that’s not enough. The Middlepool people are nervous about the whole
thing. You know Swalecliffe&mdash;he’s the Nonconformist minister&mdash;one of
those confounded busybodies who go poking their noses into everybody’s
private life. He’s on my committee. He and Ford control the dissenting
interest between them.... They’ve got it into their heads that they want
the truth from you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Who is Ford?<a name="page_074" id="page_074"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Oh, he’s the richest man in Middlepool. He’s one of my directors on the
Middlepool Investment Trust. Hard as nails! Shrewd as they make ’em! But
a Nonconformist to the tips of his fingers. He’s just built a
Congregational church out of his own pocket. He’s a corker to deal with.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>But I don’t understand. What do these men want Kate to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>They’re coming here at five o’clock with Boyce, my agent, to ask Kate if
there’s any truth in the rumours.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>But it’s outrageous!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Of course it’s outrageous! But what d’you expect from a parcel of
sneaking Middlepool dissenters?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>And what do you expect Kate to say?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>She’s going to say it’s the first she’s heard of it. Then they’re going
to ask her if she’s divorcing me, and she’s going to&mdash;repudiate the
suggestion with all the scorn at her command.<a name="page_075" id="page_075"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I refuse to see these people.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Do you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Satirically.</i>] Or do you want me to tell them before your face that
every word they’ve heard is true? Yes, I’ll see them. I’ll settle the
whole thing. And then I shall be rid of this persecution. But I shall

<p>Don’t be irritating, Bob.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>My dear, a wise Prime Minister looks upon it as a privilege to fulfil
the intelligent anticipations of the press.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>I hope it’s not true that you’re going to give Emily Lascelles the Home
Office?<a name="page_077" id="page_077"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens, you talk as if your sex were already comfortably installed
in the House.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>You know perfectly what I mean. It doesn’t matter about the men, because
all the work is done by the permanent officials. But their wives are
quite another matter. I tell you frankly it will be a great mistake if
Emily Lascelles goes to the Home Office.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>She can’t entertain. She doesn’t know a word of French. She dresses
abominably.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ironically.</i>] That settles it. Emily Lascelles shall not go to the

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Oh, George, Frank bought a print of Napoleon the other day that he wants

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gravely.</i>] Have you come to see me by arrangement?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>I suppose not.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>But your husband’s presence leads me to suppose that your common sense
has made my errand unnecessary.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Haven’t you heard of the life we led together?<a name="page_079" id="page_079"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>I make a point of never believing the disagreeable things that are said
about a man who subscribes so handsomely to the Party funds as your
husband.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Then I have you against me too?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>My dear child, I’ve known you all your life. Your mother is my first
cousin. We all desire nothing more than your happiness.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>George was served with the petition this morning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>Ah!... It appears that two prominent supporters of your husband are
coming up from Middlepool this afternoon to get from your own lips a
denial of the rumours that have been circulating in the constituency.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I can promise you that they’re not going to get it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>I wish I could persuade you to pause before you take such an irrevocable
step.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>But why should you care?<a name="page_080" id="page_080"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>We’ve been in for six years. We’re dissolving Parliament at once. I
don’t know if we shall get in again. It’ll be a very close shave. We
can’t afford to risk a couple of seats....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>A couple?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>The Chief Whip tells me that your husband proposes to lodge a counter
petition.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>If it weren’t so odious, the idea would be laughable. I promise you
that....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>Yes, yes, of course. Neither you nor Robert Colby has anything to
reproach himself with. That is obvious. But ... well, I gather that the
evidence is such that a <i>prima facie</i> case could be made out. It would
be awkward just at this moment, for all of us&mdash;I myself could wish that
my relationship to your dear mother weren’t quite so close. The British
people for some reason always judge moral delinquencies on the Radical
side with great severity. I have always thought it a hardship that the
Tories should have a sort of prescriptive right to the more amusing
forms of immorality.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Let us understand one another plainly. Do you<a name="page_081" id="page_081"></a> mean that if my husband
drags Robert Colby through the Divorce Court, you’ll throw Robert
overboard, even if his innocence is proved through and through?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>My dear, no one is so innocent that there’s not occasion for many people
to shake their heads and say: One never knows. I don’t suppose any Prime
Minister would invite a man to enter his cabinet who’d been
co-respondent in a divorce suit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>It’s nothing short of blackmail. George makes no concealment of the
fact.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>He has a brutal frankness which is sometimes rather engaging.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh, you drive me mad. My whole happiness is at stake, and you can pause
to smile at that odious cynicism.... You’ve known Robert and me all our
lives. Won’t you believe in us? Won’t you stand by us?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Very kindly.</i>] My dear, in the position entrusted to me I can’t take
risks.... I dare say you know that one of the items in our programme is
a modified form of compulsory service. I don’t know that I altogether
like it myself, but it’ll take the wind out of the Tory sails, and we’ve
got to do something.<a name="page_082" id="page_082"></a> Robert has enthusiasm and he believes in the
measure. He’s just the man to pilot it through the House.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>He’s set his heart on getting the War Office.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Well, you have it in your hands to give it him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I? Does he know that George Winter has made certain threats?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>I think not.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh, what a responsibility you put upon me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>That generally goes with power, and at the moment you have that too.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a moment’s reflection.</i>] Robert and I have never hidden anything
from one another. He wouldn’t wish me to decide on a matter that
concerns us both so nearly without consulting him. Do you object to my
putting the whole thing before him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>Not a bit! But I can tell you at once what his answer will be. He’ll say
that he loves you, and if<a name="page_083" id="page_083"></a> he must choose between you and everything
that has seemed to make his life worth living, he chooses you without a
moment’s hesitation.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Catherine</span> <i>gives a little sigh of relief and delight</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>But while he’s in the very act of renouncing the world for your sake,
look into his eyes, and perhaps you’ll see in them&mdash;oh, only for a
moment, and you’ll have to look sharply&mdash;the shadow, the merest shadow
of regret.... And perhaps in ten years, when I bring an ill-spent life
to a close, you’ll say to yourself: If I hadn’t sacrificed him, he might
be standing now in the shoes of that poor old incompetent Perigal.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hoarsely, more moved than she wishes to show.</i>] I don’t believe Robert
is ambitious.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>You have to be a shrewd observer always to know the difference between
ambition and patriotism.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I could think the world well lost for love.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>Yes, but you’re a woman. D’you think a man can?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Catherine</span> <i>does not answer. Her face expresses the agony of her

<p>If you had a bad temper I think I should love it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quite cheerfully, as if she were bantering.</i>] I want to put a purely
hypothetical case to you. Supposing you had to choose between me and
your career&mdash;which would you choose?<a name="page_089" id="page_089"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] You, of course.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>How glibly you say it!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>Fortunately I shall never be forced to make such a tremendous choice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>Then why the dickens do you suggest it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Because I’m nervous and restless and rather bored. I wanted to hear you
say that you wouldn’t hesitate to sacrifice the world for my sake.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

<p>You absurd, delightful creature!</p>

<p>I thought Dr. O’Farrell said you were to stay upstairs till to-morrow,

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Perigal.</span></p>

<p>I looked at it blankly, and then she said: Don’t you remember? It’s
so-and-so. It gave me quite a start. It was the photograph of a young
lady I’d been so madly in love with that I asked her to bolt with
me&mdash;married woman and all that sort of thing&mdash;and, would you believe it?
thirty years have passed since then, and upon my soul I didn’t know her
from Adam!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Well, my friends, I do. I’m not a high-minded, quixotic fellow like you,
and I don’t mind telling you that I find it very agreeable to be
Secretary for Foreign Affairs and Prime Minister. And yet, at the<a name="page_092" id="page_092"></a> time,
if anyone had given me the choice between my present position and a trip
across Europe with the object of my affections, I wouldn’t have
hesitated.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Colby.</span></p>

he wants me to sign cheques. I can do it just as well here as at the

<p>By Jove, I’d forgotten all about them. I say, George, you made a mistake
in letting them come.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>And I’ve told Lady Francis that we shall want this room to ourselves,
and no one’s to come in without knocking at the door.</p>

<p>By the way, was it you who sent for Bennett?<a name="page_095" id="page_095"></a></p>

<p>I’m sure his lordship would like to have a look at it.</p>

<p>Yes, hand it over, Bennett. This is really a thrilling moment. I believe
I’m going to make my fortune at last.</p>

<p>[<i>Putting down the report with a slight sigh of relief.</i>] Ah!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Is this true, Mr. Bennett?<a name="page_098" id="page_098"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid it is, my lord.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You’re chairman of the Syndicate. Your opinion can’t fail to be
valuable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hesitatingly.</i>] We must just pocket our loss.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>H’m!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>With things in their present state a loss like that is about as much as
we can stand.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>The slump must come to an end soon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>We’ve been saying that for the last two months.<a name="page_099" id="page_099"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Then what the deuce is to be done?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>That’s what we’re asking you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>We’ve got the Lewishams to reckon with.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Now’s their time to make a raid on us.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>George, don’t play the fool now. I’ve put all my eggs in this basket. I
thought I was going to be rich at last. I wanted to get out of the whole
thing. I wanted to live quietly and comfortably.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>What are you going to do, Governor?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smcap">Etchingham</span>.] Suppress the report.</p>

<p><a name="page_100" id="page_100"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Go ahead as if we believed in the mine. We’ve got the Government
expert’s report on which we bought the thing. We’ll put that in the
prospectus.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>But isn’t that dishonest?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Very.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>George!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>It’s an axiom in mining circles that when you’ve got hold of a rotten
thing the proper course is to pass it on to the British public.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>The public will find out there’s no gold there when you pay no
dividends.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Oh, we’ll pay dividends for a year or two. By then we shall have turned
the corner, and we’ll find another carrot for the British public.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>But you say yourself it’s dishonest.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>There’s another point you seem to have forgotten.<a name="page_101" id="page_101"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>What is that?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">George Winter</span> <i>pauses and looks at him for an instant
reflectively</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>We paid for the mine with money that didn’t belong to us.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>What d’you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>We’re in exactly the same position as the shop-boy who sneaks five bob
from his master’s till to put it on a horse. If the horse comes in he
puts it back, and if it doesn’t, he gets a month’s hard labour.... We
shall get seven years.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>What are you talking about, George?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Has it escaped your memory that you and I are Directors of the
Middlepool Investment Trust?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>We had to plank down eighty thousand pounds within twenty-four hours or
lose the mine.<a name="page_102" id="page_102"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>It looked like a certainty.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>At that moment it was impossible for us to raise anything like that sum.
The bank held a hundred thousand pounds of bearer bonds for the
Middlepool Investment Trust. They delivered them on an order signed by
you, me, and Bennett. We borrowed on them and completed the purchase of
a worthless mine.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>But I’ve never signed anything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>Yes, you did, my lord. They wouldn’t have delivered the bonds without.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Then my signature’s been forged.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you remember one day, after an excellent luncheon at Pym’s, you
were just off to a wedding, and I asked you to come up into the office
and sign some papers?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>But I never looked at them. I didn’t know....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting blandly.</i>] Ah, that’s your affair.<a name="page_103" id="page_103"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indignantly.</i>] I shall go to the police.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>D’you think you’ve got a plausible story to tell them? It sounds
devilish improbable that a business man, a chairman of half a dozen
companies, should sign documents without looking at them. Bennett and I
will swear that you carefully read everything that was put before
you&mdash;as, indeed, was your duty, my dear friend&mdash;and fully understood the
nature of your act.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Bennett, you’ll testify that I never realized for a moment what I
was doing. You told me they were purely formal documents. I saw George
sign them. I added my signature without hesitation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I think Mr. Bennett would be more than human if he cleared you at his
own expense.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>If there were any trouble, my lord, I should have to tell the truth.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>That’s just what I want you to do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>I should have to say that you agreed with us in<a name="page_104" id="page_104"></a> the necessity of
borrowing the bonds with the idea of putting them back as soon as we’d
floated the company, and that you signed the order to the bank with full
knowledge of the seriousness of your act.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>What is truth, said jesting Pilate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>You’re just as deep in it as we are, my lord.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my God!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>It’s no use losing one’s head because one’s in a tight place.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>You’ve tricked me. You’re a common swindler. In a month we may all be in
prison.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I hear they make you very comfortable there nowadays.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Well, I see my duty before me. I didn’t know, but now there can be no
excuse for me. I must go to Scotland Yard at once. I shall make a clean
breast of the whole thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>D’you think that’ll help you? It may mean five years instead of seven.<a name="page_105" id="page_105"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Every one will know that I’m incapable of such an act.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be a silly fool. Listen to me. We’ve got you tight. If we go
under, you go under too. Let there be no doubt in your mind about that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I must do my duty.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Your duty is to keep your head and help us out of the mess as best you
can.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>But nothing can be done. The mine’s worthless. How are we to raise
eighty thousand pounds?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>We’ve got six weeks before we need replace the bonds. If we can do it by
then no one will ever know they’ve left the cellars of the bank.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>There’s no more chance of replacing them in six weeks than there is the
day after to-morrow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Yes, there is, if we can float the company. That’s where you come in.
I’ve got to keep my seat. I<a name="page_106" id="page_106"></a> want all my prestige. I can’t have a
divorce. You must go to Kate at once, and tell her that the only way she
can save you from prison is by telling these men who are coming from
Middlepool that she has no cause for complaint against me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Good God! I’d forgotten Kate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>It’s only by going on now that we can save ourselves and the money
that’s invested in our companies.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Irritably.</i>] You wouldn’t have got into such a mess with Kate if you
hadn’t made such a damned fool of yourself. Why couldn’t you leave these
women alone?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] My dear fellow, you speak as if I were to blame.
They simply flung themselves into my arms. It would have been very rude
if I hadn’t occasionally pressed them to my bosom.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>It’s not much the Governor asks you, my lord.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>To go and tell my daughter that I’m a thief and a swindler, and throw
myself on her mercy!<a name="page_107" id="page_107"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>That’s it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I’ll see you damned first!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>The alternative is prison.... It’s not very nice, penal servitude&mdash;is
it, Fred? You know all about it. You can tell him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a gasp.</i>] Governor!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>What does he mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Fred’s a solicitor who was struck off the rolls. He was sentenced to
three years for misappropriating a client’s money.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Good God! Is that true, Mr. Bennett?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ashamed.</i>] Yes, my lord.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I never knew.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Of course you didn’t. It’s not the kind of thing<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a> you’d expect him to
brag about, is it? But it’ll go worse with him if we’re found out,
because he’s been at it before. Tell him what it’s like, Fred.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With agony.</i>] Oh, Governor, don’t!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I knew him before he went in. His name was Feltman then. And when they
let him out I took him because I felt sure he had everything to gain by
sticking to me, and everything to lose by giving me away.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>My God!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>He can tell you what you’re in for. What the broad arrow’s like to wear,
and what the food’s like to eat. And the work&mdash;it’s a healthy life,
regular hours&mdash;you’re strong for your age. I don’t see why you shouldn’t
break stones in the quarries with the rest of us. Hour after hour with
your back feeling as if it were going to break, and your arms aching,
aching, but not so badly as your heart.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Bennett</span> <i>breaks down and sobs, difficultly trying to restrain
himself</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>And you count the days, three hundred and sixty-five in a year, and you
wonder if they’ll ever come to<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a> an end. And your mind keeps on working.
It wouldn’t be so bad if you were a brainless hulk like the man who’s
sweating away beside you; but you think, and you can’t help thinking.
And you curse yourself. And you think of the people outside who are free
to do as they like, and you think of the spring-time and the flowers,
and you think of the pleasant streets of London. And then there’s the
regret which wrings your heart day after day, and you wish&mdash;you wish a
thousand times you were dead. You sleep, you’re too tired not to, even
though you’ve got hunger gnawing at your vitals, for you’re hungry,
always hungry&mdash;and in your sleep you dream that you’re back again in
your home, happy and comfortable; and when you wake up and feel your
hard prison bed, you cry like a child.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my God! My God!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>And then when you come out, it’s not over. You slink along the streets,
feeling that it’s written on your forehead for every one to see, and
your heart beats when you catch sight of a policeman. And at night it
all comes back to you. You see it again, the warders, the convict gang,
the prison food, and your back aches with the labour. And you wake
shrieking with terror, shrieking, shrieking!</p>

<p>When I suggested to Lord Francis that it would be more convenient for
you to come here, he put his house at my disposal. My wife is staying

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Clearing his throat.</i>] I should like to say, before we go any further,
that it is with the greatest regret that Mr. Ford and I have come up to
London on such an errand.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>There’s been a lot of gossip in Middlepool, and, well, we thought the
shortest way to settle it was....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>I personally don’t think this is a matter of which the committee ought
to take any notice. A man’s private life is his private life, and....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>That’s all very well, Colonel. Winter’s an old friend<a name="page_120" id="page_120"></a> of mine. We’ve
had business dealings together for the past twenty years. But ... well,
it’s a question of winning the election or losing it. There’s never been
much in it one way or another, and fifty votes more or less will make
all the difference.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>I want to tell you frankly, Mr. Winter, that I should feel it my duty to
vote against you, if there were any truth in the reports that have been
going about. And I should feel it my duty to advise my congregation to
follow my example.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>That’s clear enough in all conscience. Gentlemen, the best answer I can
make to you is that I receive you in my father-in-law’s house. My wife
is upstairs in her mother’s boudoir. I give you my word of honour that
there is not the smallest shadow of truth in any single syllable that
you have heard. I have issued a writ for libel against the <i>Herald</i>,
and....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>Surely that ought to satisfy anyone.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Well, it doesn’t satisfy me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps you would like my father-in-law to tell you that every word I
say is scrupulously true?<a name="page_121" id="page_121"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>We don’t doubt your word, Mr. Winter, but we came to London with a
particular object.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>I must say I thought from the beginning it was open to the gravest
question.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>The committee discussed it at length, and the majority agreed that....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rising.</i>] Of course, of course, Etchingham, will you give these
gentlemen the assurance?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>After a moment’s hesitation.</i>] I think the whole thing’s damned
impertinent.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>That’s exactly what I said.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quietly.</i>] You’re only wasting time, Winter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>We made up our minds that we must have a certain assurance from the lips
of Mrs. Winter.<a name="page_122" id="page_122"></a> Then we can go back to Middlepool with comfortable
minds.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Trying bluster.</i>] D’you mean to say you wish to cross-examine my wife?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>I merely wish her to answer the questions that were put to you in
Colonel Boyce’s letter on behalf of the committee.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pretending to fly into a violent passion.</i>] No decent woman would
stand it. I refuse to ask my wife to expose herself to such a
degradation.</p>

George Winter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I’d sooner lose my seat than expose a defenceless woman to such
humiliation. You can go and tell that to your committee and be damned to
you!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>But we came up from Middlepool on the understanding that we were to see
your wife, Mr. Winter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>My wife is in very delicate health.<a name="page_123" id="page_123"></a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>They wait in silence. In a moment</i> <span class="smcap">Catherine</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p></div>

<p>These are the gentlemen of whom I spoke to you. Gentlemen, here is my
wife.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Cordially.</i>] How d’you do, Mrs. Winter? Pleased to see you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] How d’you do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>We’ve not had the pleasure of welcoming you in Middlepool for some time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I’ve not been very well lately.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">George Winter</span>.] Will you put the question to Mrs. Winter that we
set in our letter to you of the day before yesterday?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>No, sir. If you’re not ashamed to ask the question you may ask it
yourself.<a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>I am a stranger to Mrs. Winter. The matter requires some explanation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>It’s no use making any bones about it, Swalecliffe. Mrs. Winter, I’m
sorry to put you in this position, but there it is, and it can’t be
helped. There are busybodies everywhere, and Middlepool has its fair
share of them. There’s been a lot of gossip about you and your good man,
and if we don’t look out it’ll lose him the election.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>What do you want me to say to you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Well, we want to be able to go back to Middlepool and tell them we’ve
had it from your own lips that there’s no truth in these reports.</p>

<p>[<i>Kindly.</i>] Yes, yes, we won’t bother you any more. Thank you, very
much! And I’m glad that you’ve put our minds at rest. George Winter,
shake hands.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I’ll shake hands with you, but I can’t help saying that I could have
expected more charity, more confidence in me from men who make a
practice of belief in the Christian Church.</p>

gentlemen.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Bennett will show you out. Good-bye. Good-bye, Boyce. I shall be up

<div class="blockquott"><p class="hang"><i>The scene is a spacious sitting-room in the Palace Hotel at
Middlepool. It is sumptuously furnished with the lack of taste
peculiar to such apartments. Everything is large and rich and
rather stiff. It is obvious that the decorations have been carried
out on contract by a first-rate firm. They are calculated to give
the business man who engages the room the impression that he is
getting his money’s worth.</i></p>

<p>Good Lord, I’ve not slept for a week. They go on all night.<a name="page_130" id="page_130"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>They worried me a bit last night. And when I did get to sleep I heard
them whistling away through my dreams.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>They don’t seem to trouble Winter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>If they did I suppose he wouldn’t come to this hotel.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Nodding in the direction of</i> <span class="smcap">George Winter’s</span> <i>room</i>.] He sleeps next
door, doesn’t he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>He told me he slept like a top last night.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Simultaneously.</i>] He looked as fresh as paint this morning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>And his room’s practically on the line.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Oh, nonsense.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Yes, it is. You just walk down a flight of steps into the garden, and
there you are within twenty feet of the line.<a name="page_131" id="page_131"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Worst place in Middlepool for a hotel. I told them so when they came to
me about it. Wanted me to put money in it. Not me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Breaking in before</i> <span class="smcap">James Ford</span> <i>has finished</i>.] Surely Mr. Winter
ought to be here by now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>You won’t make him come any quicker by looking out of the window.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>Every moment’s valuable. Something ought to be done at once.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] Don’t you know where he is, Colonel?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>He was booked to speak to the men at Parker and Gibbons at 10.30. But
you know what he is. Half a dozen places at once. He’s about the most
difficult person to catch I know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>Have you sent down to Parker and Gibbons?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>Yes, of course I have; I’ve sent a dozen fellows after him to tell him
to come to the hotel at once.<a name="page_132" id="page_132"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Talking through.</i>] You’ve been careful? You’ve not ...?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>You don’t think I’m a beginner at this game, do you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>Well, I didn’t know how you’d made him understand what had happened.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>He’s not made him understand. When Winter’s told he’s expected at the
Palace at once he’ll guess something’s in the wind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>You’re sure he won’t go to the Committee Rooms?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>If he does he’ll be sent on. I thought it would cause a lot of gossip if
we had a meeting there. That’s why I suggested the hotel.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] I wish to goodness you wouldn’t look so depressed, Mr.
Swalecliffe.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>You’re a business man, Mr. Ford. D’you think there’s any truth in this
article?<a name="page_133" id="page_133"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>You’d better ask Lord Francis. He’s chairman of the new company; I’m
only an investor.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>Of course there’s nothing in it. The whole thing’s a malicious libel.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Well, we’ll hear what Winter’s got to say about it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Simultaneously.</i>] My Lord, I wish he’d come.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">James Ford</span>.] You don’t mean to say you think there’s anything in
it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>I’ve applied for ten thousand shares. You don’t suppose I like it when
an article comes out in a financial paper on the day of issue that the
mine’s practically worked out, and Winter’s expert has reported that the
ore’s not worth the cost of crushing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>Everybody who’s got a penny to spare in Middlepool has applied for
shares.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>George Winter told me it was the biggest thing he’d ever had.<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>He’s never let you down before. Why should he let you down now?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>I don’t say he’s let me down. But he told me to put my shirt on it, and
... I don’t want ten thousand worthless shares.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>The damnable thing is that it should happen on the day of the election.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>It would be monstrous if people didn’t vote for him because of an
article in a London newspaper.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>You know what people are. They lose their heads. The seat has always
been won and lost on the wobblers.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Oh, the first thing is to win the seat.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>Well, we shan’t do that unless Mr. Winter comes at once and we make up
our minds what to do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Ring up the Committee Rooms, Boyce, and ask if anything’s been heard of
him.<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>All right. I’ll do that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>I was never so taken aback as when Boyce showed me the telephone message
from London.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>When do the London papers get here, Mr. Ford?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>They ought to be here by half-past ten.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Speaking into the receiver.</i>] Put me on 78, will you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Simultaneously.</i>] Why the devil don’t they bring them in?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>Don’t worry. I’ve told a waiter to bring them as soon as they arrive.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>[<i>At the telephone.</i>] I say, is that you, Masters? Has Mr. Winter been
there? Well, send Rogers. Here. No, here, confound you! The Palace.
[<i>Putting down the receiver.</i>] No, nothing’s been seen of him since
early this morning.<a name="page_136" id="page_136"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I wonder what the other side are going to do when they hear this.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Oh, don’t you be afraid. They heard about the attack as soon as ever we
did.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>You ought to have held the line and prevented them from getting on to
London.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>Good God, one can’t think of everything at once.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>It seems to me the whole thing has been about as disgracefully
mismanaged as it could be.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>If you’d ever tried to run an election you’d know it wasn’t so easy as
all that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I’m not an election agent. It’s not my business.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Come, come, gentlemen, it’s no good quarrelling about it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>These three speeches are spoken at once.</i></p></div>

<p><a name="page_137" id="page_137"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>How is the polling going on?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I think we shall have the heaviest poll we’ve ever had.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Of course there’ll be some slackening off just now. A lot of working men
voted when the polling stations opened.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>There’ll be twice as many at the dinner-hour.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>You don’t know what the Tories are doing, Colonel?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>I should think I did know. They’re going to set up the article as soon
as it comes in.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>The whole article?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>The whole confounded thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>And placard the streets with it. They’ve made arrangements to print off
a thousand, and they’ve got their bill stickers all ready and waiting.<a name="page_138" id="page_138"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>It’s infamous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense! It’s business. We’d have done the same if we’d had the luck to
get such a stick as this to beat Morrison with the very morning of the
election.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>The comfort is, they don’t know Morrison and they do know Winter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>That’s the danger, too. They may know him too well.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what the devil you mean by that. You seem to forget that
you’re speaking of my son-in-law.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Oh, we’re not here to pay one another compliments.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>If you’ll wait a minute or two he’ll be here himself and you can say to
him anything you want to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Boyce.</span></p>

<p>What I can’t make out is why he chose this particular day to bring out
his company.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>He didn’t think the election would take place just yet.<a name="page_139" id="page_139"></a></p>

<p>Every one’s been talking of a general election for the last two months.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>You know it was sprung upon us at the end.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Swalecliffe.</span></p>

<p>Couldn’t he have kept the issue back?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>He’d got everything fixed up by then.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Speaking through.</i>] Of course he could. It was only his obstinacy. I
told him it was a bad time to give an American issue to the public.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

paid eighty thousand pounds for this precious mine. It would perhaps be
interesting to inquire how he was able to raise such a sum at a time not
only of general stringency, but of peculiar difficulty in the Central
American market. Perhaps Mr. Winter, like King Midas, is able to turn
into gold everything he touches and he may have been able to change his
office furniture into precious metal. Perhaps not.” Childish, isn’t it?

Kensal Green.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>And the worst of it is.... [<i>He breaks off.</i>] At first I was overcome
with the horror of it. But little by little I’ve got used to it, used to
your being a thief and a swindler.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a chuckle.</i>] You put things rather bluntly, don’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>And Bennett was a convict. It all seems quite natural now. And I can
talk and laugh with you. And I eat by your side every day.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>One can’t make a fortune without taking risks.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>There are always those missing bonds. They’re in my thoughts day and
night.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>No one can make inquiries for three weeks. By<a name="page_161" id="page_161"></a> that time we shall have
gone to allotment, and the bonds will be safely back in the black box.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>But will you be able to go to allotment?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Of course we shall. This article isn’t going to do us any harm. I shall
win the seat. That’ll give these Middlepool people confidence.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>George, I believe Ford is uneasy. I don’t trust him. Supposing he found
out about the bonds?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>It might be devilish expensive.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>You’ll never buy him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I never met the man yet who hadn’t his price. Flattery if he’s a fool,
hard cash if he’s a wise man. But a price of some sort. There’s always a
price.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Take care of Ford, George.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] I’m not frightened.<a name="page_162" id="page_162"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Sometimes I’m afraid, you’re so confident. It’s impossible a thing like
this can end well.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>I believe in my star. I’ve been in tight corners before, but I’ve
wriggled out of them. I’m stronger than ever I was. I’ve got ten times
more brains than any of my competitors. The ball is at my feet and I’ve
only got to set it rolling. What d’you think difficulties are to me?
I’ve never been in better spirits, so alert, so buoyant, as during these
last weeks when my neck has been in a noose and every policeman I passed
might have a warrant in his pocket for my arrest. If there were ten
times more difficulties I’d overcome them all. In ten years I shall be
the richest man in London. In fifteen I shall be a peer. My God, I feel
as if the world were an orange and I’d got my teeth into it, and I shall
suck it dry.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I wonder how many ruined lives will be sacrificed to give you all you
want. You walk over dead bodies and broken hearts.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Rot! I flutter the will-o’-the-wisp of gain before the covetous, and
they follow. They want to make money without working for it. Well, I’m
cleverer than they are. Swalecliffe gambles with his five hundred
pounds. His five hundred pounds will find<a name="page_163" id="page_163"></a> its way into my pocket. It’s
his own look out. Each for himself and the devil take the hindmost.
[<i>With a start.</i>] By George, I’ve got an idea.... The Lewishams can’t
attack my stocks without weakening their own. We’re in the same boat,
and if one of us shakes it both’ll topple out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>What d’you mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Well, we’ll attack the Lewishams. I’ll get on to MacLaren’s at once. Go
to the post office and wire to Bennett. He’s sure to call at the office.
<i>Sell Lewishams.</i> He’ll twig. By George, that’s the ticket. Why didn’t I
think of it before? We’ll make the Lewishams sorry they started this
game.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>But supposing ...?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Good God, man, don’t suppose, do as I tell you. Don’t you see we’ve got
nothing to lose and everything to gain? I know my luck’s in. And I
follow my luck. That’s genius.</p>

<h3>SCENE II</h3>

<div class="blockquott"><p class="hang"><i>The scene takes place in the sitting-room of the Palace Hotel, but
it is eleven o’clock at night. Only a reading lamp is lit, the
light of which falls on</i> <span class="smcap">Catherine</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Francis</span>. <span class="smcap">Catherine</span>
<i>is working at some embroidery</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Can you see, dear? Wouldn’t you like some more light?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With an affectionate smile.</i>] No, the light hurts my eyes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>You’re looking very pale, darling.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I haven’t been sleeping very well here. We’re so near the trains, and
they seem to run all night.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>I wonder how George can stand it. His room is practically on the
railway.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Thank heaven, it’s over. We shall know the result in half an hour, and
to-morrow we can go.<a name="page_165" id="page_165"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>What are you going to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>What can I do? Nothing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid you’re very unhappy, Kate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Please don’t think that, mother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>You’ve given up everything for our sake.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I wish I could think so. I gave up my divorce because&mdash;because I was
afraid. I couldn’t risk the regret that Robert might feel later. I
should always have been looking for it.... One must never forget that
love is a woman’s whole life, but it’s never more than part of a man’s,
never.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>What did you tell him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I wrote and said I found it impossible to go on with my action. I begged
him not to try to move me. I told him I was very unhappy.<a name="page_166" id="page_166"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>Poor child.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>He wrote very kindly. He made it as easy for me as he could. And now
it’s all over. I’ve lost my last chance of happiness. I’m bound to my
husband for the rest of my life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>And do you still love Robert?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Yes. And I’m glad of what I’ve done. The only thing that
helps me is the pride I take in all the great things he’s going to do.
And it will have been me. I gave him the opportunity.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Anne</span> <i>comes in. She is wearing a coat and skirt and a hat.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Well! You are strange people. How on earth can you sit there and sew
while the counting’s going on? I’ve never been so excited in my life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Why have you come back?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Well, it’s nearly finished now. Teddie said there’d be rather a
scrummage when the result was known, and I’d better get out of the way.<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Obedient creature.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It rather amuses me to be ordered about. Besides, I couldn’t help seeing
that nobody wanted me. Teddie promised he’d bolt round as soon as the
result was out. I say, let’s have some light, shall we?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She turns on the electricity, and the room is suddenly a glare of
light.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>You’ll blind us.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>I love an election. I’ve never had such a time in my life. I’ve enjoyed
every minute of these three weeks. I hope Teddie’ll go into Parliament.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Raising her eyebrows.</i>] On four hundred a year?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, George will give us a rise. He says Teddie’s awfully useful. George
<i>is</i> good, isn’t he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I’m glad you’re so happy, darling.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Abruptly, after a little, quick look at her.</i>] You’re not angry with
us, Kate?<a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens, why should I be?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>You know, it’s so dreadfully hard to pretend I haven’t got eyes in my
head.... Why don’t you make it up with George, Katie?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what makes you think there’s anything to make up.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, what I didn’t guess for myself Teddie told me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>He would have been wiser to mind his own business.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>It was rather....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>If you knew how things were between George and myself, and you were
willing to accept his favours what do you expect me to say? I didn’t ask
you not to. I knew if I had you would only have refused. I’m cynical
enough to know that in this world each of us takes care of his own
interests.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>My dear, don’t be so bitter.<a name="page_169" id="page_169"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>One has to take people as one finds them; George has always been
charming to me. If you’d only make allowances for him....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting vehemently.</i>] Oh, my dear, don’t. I’m not in the humour
to stand that. Leave me to lead my own life without interference. Surely
it’s enough that to bind me to him George should give you an income to
marry on. You can’t want more from me than that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my dear, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to say anything that would hurt
you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Recovering herself.</i>] You haven’t. Forgive me. I didn’t mean to make a
scene, but my nerves are a little upset. I’m a very weak, selfish woman,
audit’s dreadfully hard to be half as angelic as you think me. I’m very
glad that you’re going to marry Teddie. You’re in love with one another,
and if you haven’t much money, what does it matter? I’m sure you’ll be
tremendously happy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

votes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Anne.</span></p>

<p>But how did it seem to be going?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Winter, Morrison, Winter, Morrison. One vote on one side, one vote on
the other. It seemed interminable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Lady Francis.</span></p>

<p>He won by seventy-five last time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Who can tell the effect of all these rumours and suspicions and attacks?
They may just have made the difference. Oh, it’s maddening.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Sit down, father, and rest. You look quite done up.<a name="page_171" id="page_171"></a></p>

<p>Even George is anxious. I know his face so well. He’s trying to appear

before I decided. Now that I know the whole truth....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>The only hope we’ve got is to go on. If he gets in, if we can pull
things together, we may get out of the muddle. He’s positive of it. The
only thing that held me up was the thought of all of you. If I’d gone to
the police there and then&mdash;or made away with myself, it would have meant
the ruin of all of you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>And of all the unhappy people who’ve trusted everything they had to
George.</p>

part?</p>

<p>Oh, don’t think of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I believe if he wins the election he’ll be strong enough to force the

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>But if the mine’s worthless?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

They’ll have to take me in. We’ll combine our interests, and then we

too, James. You’re going to be a richer man than you guess. And when I’m
in with the Lewishams I shall bide my time. Manny Lewisham can’t last
much longer, and his sons are fools. When he’s gone I shall get the
whole business in my hands. I’ve got ten times more brains than anyone
in that market. There’s no one who can stand against me.</p>

down and speak in the Cattle Market, and when I got there I found

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>[<i>More sternly.</i>] You had no more right to touch them than my office boy

<p>What the devil d’you mean by that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>I’m a director of the Middlepool Investment Trust. I insist on the bonds
being produced at once.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>They shall be produced in a fortnight.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>No, no, my friend, that won’t do.</p>

<p>It’s no good trying to bluster with me, George. I’ve seen you do it at
shareholders’ meetings and very effective it is sometimes, but this
isn’t the time for it.</p>

to pay for it. I shall get them back as soon as the money comes in from
the issue. Now you’ve got it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>It’s theft pure and simple.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Insolently.</i>] I suppose you want to come in with me. [<i>He does not
notice</i> <span class="smcap">James Ford’s</span> <i>instinctive movement of repulsion</i>.] I’ll give you
your shares for nothing. That means ten thousand pounds, and if you hold
on to them they’ll be worth fifty thousand in a year.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Thank you. I’m not going to risk a lifetime’s honest work for a few
thousand pounds.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a slight smile.</i>] You’ve been Mayor of Middlepool twice, and
you’ve done a lot of work for the party. I can’t help thinking it’s
almost time the Government showed some appreciation of your services.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>You’ve mistaken your man, George Winter. I’ve worked like a nigger for
thirty years. I’ve not let any chance slip by me, but I’ve never done
anything that a man need be ashamed of. I’ve built up an honest business
to leave to my sons, and an honest name. I’m too old to start being a
rogue now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] I thought you wanted to talk business.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Right’s right, and wrong’s wrong. You can’t get over that. I couldn’t
rest for a moment if I thought any act of mine wasn’t above board. It’s

<p>[<i>Desperately.</i>] How can I make you understand? You don’t seem to see

don’t want to be hard on you. I must do my duty. I’m a director of the
company. I put all my friends in it. I put my sister into it. And this
mine. Is it true what that paper says? For all I know that’s a swindle
too.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With sudden anxiety.</i>] You’re not going to push me down now that I’m
almost at the top of the tree? I’ve got the world at my feet. If you’ll
only give me a month I can put everything straight.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>Five minutes ago it was a fortnight. I don’t believe it. These things
don’t come right. When a<a name="page_193" id="page_193"></a> man has crossed the line that separates
honesty from dishonesty he never gets back.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>If you give me away now it’ll mean a general smash. The only chance of
saving things is to go on. The money’s gone. You won’t get it back by
giving me up to the police.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>I must take my chance of that. After all, if I don’t speak it makes me a
party to the crime. It can be proved that I went to the bank to-day.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Now you’re saying something I can understand. If I show you by plain
figures that I can put everything right if you’ll only give me time....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>I tell you I can’t. I’ve got my wife to think of, and my boys. It’s
theft, it’s the money of orphans and widows that you’ve taken, and
there’s only one course open to me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>What are you going to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>I must&mdash;I must consult the Chief Constable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You wouldn’t do that? You don’t seriously mean that you’d go to the
police? It’s madness. It’s so impractical. It’s stupid.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>I could never respect myself again if I.... It’s a matter between my
conscience and myself.... Oh, George, why have you put me in this
position?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Look here, old man, I’ve done wrong. I admit it. I’ve done something
that other men have done before me and it’s come out all right. At the
time I thought the slump would only last a few days, and I thought I
should be able to replace the bonds in a week. It’s the only slip I’ve
made. Don’t be too hard on me.... [<i>With a break in his voice.</i>] Have
mercy as you hope in your turn to have mercy shown to you. Don’t ruin me
for this one mistake. Let it mean something to you that I’m humiliating
myself before you.... It wasn’t a crime. It was only thoughtlessness.

<p>[<i>Hardly knowing what he is saying.</i>] But no one could get it. You know
it’s impossible. Even<a name="page_196" id="page_196"></a> if you gave me a week I couldn’t do it. I can’t,
I can’t, I can’t. With the attack on us to-day we’re&mdash;we’re tottering.
It’s as much as we shall be able to do to hold out till the tide turns.
That’s not giving me a chance. Not a chance. To-morrow! It’s absurd!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>That’s my last word.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>You might as well send for the police at once. Oh, my God! It’s
impossible.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

<p>If the money is not there by the time the bank closes I shall apply for
a warrant.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>D’you know what that means? It means a trial, and then&mdash;and then prison.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">James Ford.</span></p>

me. It’s envy. I knew you envied me all the time. D’you think I’ve been

along. You didn’t fight me like a man. You just sided with me, waiting

<p>James Ford knows that the bonds have gone. And he’s going to Scotland

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh! And father?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I can’t worry about your father now. He must look after his own

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

me. He wants to kick me off my perch, so that he can take my place. And
I know him. I know him inside out. He’ll do what he says. [<i>With angry

<p>Bennett would give me away to save himself. I know him. There’s not a

America, to be brought back in six months by a couple of detectives? Not
much.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be better to stay and face it? If you’ve done wrong, can’t
you accept your punishment? You’re young still.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">George Winter.</span></p>

<p>They won’t have mercy on me. It’ll mean ten years. And when I come out,
it’ll mean hiding, doing odd jobs, like Bennett, dirty work for other
men who won’t risk their own skins. And what d’you suppose a life like
that is worth to me? I want the power, and the notoriety, and the
glamour. I wanted men to point me out in the street. I’ve aimed too high

what the Governor told me. I just flooded the market with selling orders
of their stocks, and at closing time Manny Lewisham sent for me. I smelt
a rat. I was too clever for him. He’s offered to take the Governor in.

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps he’s in the garden.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Bennett</span> <i>runs out through the door of</i> <span class="smcap">George Winter’s</span> <i>room. As
he does this</i>, <span class="smcap">Francis Etchingham</span> <i>comes in from the left, in his
pyjamas and a dressing-gown</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>I say, what the devil’s all this row? It’s bad enough to have the trains
banging under one’s window all night long. Upon my soul.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Where’s George? Father, father!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>How the deuce should I know?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Bennett</span> <i>comes back</i>.</p></div>

<p>He’s not in the garden anywhere.<a name="page_214" id="page_214"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I’m so frightened!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>What on earth’s the matter with you, Kate?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Oh, my God, my God!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Bennett.</span></p>

<p>We can’t find the Governor.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Etchingham.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps he’s gone for a walk.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Catherine.</span></p>

<p>Along the line?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Teddie O’Donnell</span> <i>comes running in</i>. <i>He has taken his coat and
waistcoat off.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">O’Donnell.</span></p>

<p>I say, I’ve just seen a most awful accident. A man’s been run over on
the line.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Catherine</span> <i>gives a shrill scream of horror, and, falling on her
knees, hides her face</i>.</p></div>

<p class="cend">THE END.</p>
